    abstract = "The use of low-cost sensor technology to monitor air pollution has made remarkable strides in the last decade. The development of low-cost devices to monitor air quality in indoor environments can be used to understand the behaviour of indoor air pollutants and potentially impact on the reduction of related health impacts. These user-friendly devices are portable, require low-maintenance, and can enable near real-time, continuous monitoring. They can also contribute to citizen science projects and community-driven science. However, low-cost sensors have often been associated with design compromises that hamper data reliability. Moreover, with the rapidly increasing number of studies, projects, and grey literature based on low-cost sensors, information got scattered. Intending to identify and review scientifically validated literature on this topic, this study critically summarizes the recent research pertinent to the development of indoor air quality monitoring devices using low-cost sensors. The method employed for this review was a thorough search of three scientific databases, namely: ScienceDirect, IEEE, and Scopus. A total of 891 titles published since 2012 were found and scanned for relevance. Finally, 41 research articles consisting of 35 unique device development projects were reviewed with a particular emphasis on device development: calibration and performance of sensors, the processor used, data storage and communication, and the availability of real-time remote access of sensor data. The most prominent finding of the study showed a lack of studies consisting of sensor performance as only 16 out of 35 projects performed calibration/validation of sensors. An even fewer number of studies conducted these tests with a reference instrument. Hence, a need for more studies with calibration, credible validation, and standardization of sensor performance and assessment is recommended for subsequent research."

    abstract = "The quality of buildings can be assessed in terms of the indoor air quality, thermal comfort, lighting quality, acoustic comfort afforded the occupants, collectively referred to as Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ). A major barrier to a more thoroughly representative audit of actual IEQ performance are the expense and complexity of the measurement instrumentation required. Rapid developments in sensor technology in recent years present the opportunity for continuous and pervasive IEQ monitoring to deliver truly representative characterisations of building performance at a modest cost. The last remaining obstacle to realising these developments seems to be a concern about instrument accuracy. In this paper we test the performance of a low-cost IEQ monitoring system (SAMBA) introduced in an earlier paper. Calibration data from 100 devices was analysed to calculate the standard error of the estimate as a measure of equipment accuracy. Those performance specifications were used in a Monte Carlo simulation based on measurements of thermal comfort parameters from 24 office buildings. Performance measures suggests the low-cost system, whilst not as accurate as laboratory equipment, is more than sufficient for building IEQ diagnostics and compliance assessments. Furthermore, the results of the Monte Carlo simulation show that continuous monitoring systems are better at characterising long-term performance than ad hoc measurement strategies using precision equipment. Low-cost pervasive monitoring technologies therefore offer a unique opportunity to improve our quantitative understanding of, and response to, indoor environmental quality issues."

This paper introduces SAMBA, a state-of-the-art monitoring station for continuous, real-time measurements of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) parameters from occupants’ work desks. It combines a hardware solution that integrates a low-cost suite of sensors with a software platform designed to automatically analyse and visualize data for quick interpretation of IEQ performance by non-scientist. In addition to feeding a massive IEQ database for research, the resulting data may be used to better inform the metrological requirements for popular international IEQ rating schemes. This new era of indoor environmental monitoring based upon systems such as SAMBA affords a fundamentally new approach to built environmental field research that holds significant promise to improve building performance and indoor environmental quality and occupant satisfaction, health, wellbeing and performance."

Various sensors—temperature, relative humidity, illuminance, CO2, VOC, PM2.5, and occupancy—for IEQ performance measurement are included in this toolbox. Arduino Uno boards were connected to the sensors for data acquisition. ZigBee communication protocol was established between an XBee device for each Arduino board and an XBee receiver connected to a computer. The toolbox utilized the open source, agent-based software platform VOLTTRON for data communication and analysis. The data collection system was calibrated against an accurate data acquisition card. Experiments have been conducted using the toolbox for assessing IEQ performance in an open computer lab within a commercial building. Thermal comfort, indoor air quality, and lighting performance have been analyzed based on collected data.

Indoor environment quality (IEQ) is often described as having thermal, visual, aural and olfactory dimensions, each of which is assessed subjectively by the resident. While it is possible to objectively assess physical parameters relating to these aspects of IEQ, either directly or indirectly, resident satisfaction with the environment is determined subjectively so must be inferred. In the field study of thermal comfort (FSTC) approach, objective physical measurements are collected simultaneously with resident preference and sensation information, usually via a diary or written survey. This research paper explores a new approach to residential IEQ appraisal which extends the FSTC approach to the visual, aural and olfactory dimensions using a low-cost data collection system based upon the Arduino microcontroller platform. The paper describes the design developed, presents early validation results and draws preliminary conclusions."

However, the cost of such systems is high, so they are mainly used in large buildings. This paper describes the main features and expected applications for a low-budget monitoring platform currently under development and tuning. In particular, the monitoring system was developed based on electronic prototyping platform Arduino and on sensors and devices usually available in the retail market of electronics. The monitoring platform has been designed with the following characteristics in mind: replicability, full remote control, portability, versatility, reliability and affordability."

The goal of OSBSS is to allow for more flexibility in synchronizing a large number of measurements with high spatial and temporal resolution in a cost effective manner for use in research projects and, eventually, in building automation and control. Detailed tutorials with instructions for constructing the data loggers using off-the-shelf electronic components are made available freely online. The project currently includes a variety of sensors and data loggers designed to measure a number of important parameters in buildings, including air and surface temperatures, air relative humidity, human occupancy, light intensity, CO2 concentrations, and a generic voltage data logger that can log data from a variety of other sensors such as differential pressure sensors. We also describe results from co-location tests with each data logger installed for one week in an educational building alongside their commercial counterparts, which demonstrate excellent performance at substantially lower costs."

To achieve this aim, a wireless microcontroller with attached sensors has been used to collect the environmental data. The information obtained from the sensors is collected and stored in a flash memory card, and simultaneously is sent via WiFi to the cloud. This data is stored in an online spreadsheet, which permits us to access the information in real time. On the other hand, a comparative analysis of the results obtained from sensors has been carried out, thanks to which several guidance guidelines have been developed for the selection of the most appropriate environmental sensor for each project. Finally, an additional evaluation of the device has been carried out through the analysis of its energy performance and providing information related to the data storage and its cost of development. The current research shows a clear ability to develop monitoring systems for the building sector, which can also be extended to multiple applications of Smart Environments. The development of projects through these platforms will allow future research to tackle the existing barriers in monitoring campaigns."
